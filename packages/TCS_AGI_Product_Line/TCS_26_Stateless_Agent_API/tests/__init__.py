TCS-26 Symplectic Omni-Intelligence Test Suite Initialization
-----------------------------------------------------------
This file declares the 'tests' directory as a standard Python package,
enabling test runners (e.g., unittest, pytest) to discover and execute
test modules within this folder.
"""
# Intentionally left sparse. Test discovery is handled by the runner.
# All imports within test files should refer to the parent 'tcs26_core' package 
# (e.g., 'from tcs26_core.config_consts import ...').
# No explicit exports are defined here.
