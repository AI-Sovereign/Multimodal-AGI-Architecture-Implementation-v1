# 📚 AGI Architecture Documentation Index

This directory serves as the centralized, formal entry point for all architectural specifications, technical guides, and governance policies for the Multimodal-AGI-Architecture-Implementation-v1 project.

The purpose of this documentation is to ensure absolute clarity, auditability, and replicability of the core AGI components (TCS-25 and TCS-26).
