## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Our community is built on mutual respect, empathy, and constructive professionalism. We expect all contributors to uphold the following standards:

1.  **Be Professional and Constructive:** Disagreement is inevitable, but personal attacks and disrespect are unacceptable. Criticize ideas, never people.
2.  **Ensure Integrity:** All contributions must prioritize code integrity, rigor, and the professional standards established in the repository's `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` which governs the development of the **Multimodal AGI Architecture**.
3.  **Assume Positive Intent:** Work is complex. When encountering issues, assume colleagues are attempting to improve the product.

### Enforcement

Violations of this code should be reported confidentially to the core team at `conduct@agi-architecture.com`. Consequences may include private warnings, temporary bans, or permanent exclusion from contribution, at the discretion of the repository maintainers.
